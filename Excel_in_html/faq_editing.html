        Use Tracks &gt; Mix &gt; Mix Stereo down to Mono. This converts the
        selected stereo track(s) into the same number of mono tracks, combining
        left and right channels equally. This command is not available for
        stereo tracks split into left and right channels. Stereo Track to Mono
        mixes the two channels together then reduces the volume of the mix by -६
        dB (halves the volume) to produce an average of the two channels.
        Therefore if one channel of the stereo track is louder than the other,
        the peak volume of the resulting mono track will be reduced. The
        resulting track will never clip if the original stereo track does not.

        Alternatively you can use Split Stereo to Mono from the Audio Track
        Dropdown Menu in the Track Control Panel to create separate mono tracks
        for each channel. If you want to discard one faulty or noisy channel
        entirely, use the X button top left of the track, or select the track
        then choose Tracks &gt; Remove Tracks. Split Stereo to Mono can also be
        useful if you are making a mix of multiple tracks. You have more control
        using the Pan Sliders on mono tracks than if you use the Track Dropdown
        Menu to Split Stereo Track to left and right channels.
